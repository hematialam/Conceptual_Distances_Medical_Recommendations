Prevention of Occurrence and Recurrence of Low
Back Pain
Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p. 25)
Patient Education S Provide information or patient educational material on back pain prevention and care of the healthy back to emphasize patient responsibility and workplace ergonomics (see patient information sheets and brochures). Emphasize that acute low back pain is nearly always benign and generally resolves within one to six weeks. There is inconclusive evidence to determine what quantity, intensity, or media is optimal for delivering this information. Patient information and educational material based on a biomedical or biomechanical model (anatomical and “traditional” posture information) can convey negative messages about back pain and are not recommended.	SR (G2, G5)
INSTITUTE OF HEALTH ECONOMICS

These recommendations are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. They should be used as an adjunct to sound clinical decision-making.
 
Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p. 25)
Exercise for Prevention of Recurrence S Recommend physical activity. There is inconclusive evidence to recommend for or against any specific kind of exercise, or the frequency/intensity of training.	SR (G2c, G5, IHE Database) + EO (GUC)
Advise patients who are recovering from an episode of acute low back pain that recurrent episodes are common and that remaining physically active and participating in regular exercise may reduce the likelihood of recurrences.	
Shoe Insoles/Orthoses X DO NOT recommend shoe insoles/orthoses for preventing low back pain.	RCT (G5) + SR (IHE Database)
Lumbar Supports X DO NOT recommend lumbar supports for preventing low back pain.	RCT (G3) + SR (IHE Database)
Manual Therapy - Spinal Manipulative Therapy ? There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against spinal manipulative therapy for preventing low back pain.	RCT (G5)
Manual Therapy - Spinal Mobilization ? There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against spinal mobilization for preventing low back pain.	RCT (G5)
Risk Factor Modification ? Although overweight/obesity and smoking are associated with the increased prevalence of low back pain, there is inconclusive evidence to recommend modifying overweight/obesity and smoking for preventing low back pain. There is insufficient evidence to recommend reducing alcohol consumption for the prevention of low back pain.	SR (G3, IHE Database)
Additional Options ? There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the following interventions for preventing low back pain. • Any specific type of chair	CS (G5)
• Any specific type of mattress	RCT (G5)

Acute and Subacute Low Back Pain
Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p.25)
Diagnostic Triage S The first qualified practitioner with the ability to do a full assessment (i.e., history, physical and neurological red flags, and psychosocial yellow flags) should assess the patient and undertake diagnostic triage (see Appendix E for summary of red and yellow flags, and the companion documents Clinical Assessment for Psychosocial Yellow Flags and Management of Psychosocial Yellow Flags - see complete list of companion materials). If serious spinal pathology is excluded, manage as non-specific low back pain.	SR (G2, G4)
Ankylosing Spondylitis S Consider a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, particularly in younger adults who, in the absence of injury, present with a history of needing to get out of bed at night and reduced side bending.	SR (G1)
Emergent Cases S Refer patient with red flags (see Appendix E for red flag definitions) indicating a high likelihood of serious underlying pathology for immediate evaluation and treatment to an appropriate resource depending on what is available in your region (e.g., emergency room, relevant specialist). The presence of Cauda Equina Syndrome is considered to be a surgical emergency.	EO (G2a) EO (GUC)
Cases Requiring Urgent Evaluation S Schedule an urgent appointment with a physician if any of the red flags are present (see Appendix E for red flag definitions).	EO (G2a,b)
Evaluate for Fracture S Order AP and lateral plain film imaging for low back pain when compression or other fracture is suspected. Oblique x-rays should not be done in this circumstance.	SR (G2c) + EO (GUC)
Imaging to Rule Out Underlying Pathology in the Absence of Radiculopathy S Only order imaging to clarify anatomy where the results will direct treatment. Imaging is typically not useful except for the following indications: •	MRI indications: ■	Major or progressive neurologic deficit (e.g., foot drop or functionally	SR (G2c) + SR (IHE Database)

Referral to a Spinal Care Specialist S Refer patient with disabling back or leg pain, or significant limitation of function including job-related activities, within two to six weeks to a spinal care specialist such as a physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine.	EO (G2)
Referral for Inflammatory Disease S Order a CRP and/or an ESR blood test if inflammatory disease is suspected based on patient presentation. Patients with inflammatory disease should be referred to a rheumatologist.	EO (GUC)
Laboratory Testing S Order the appropriate blood tests if cancer or infection is suspected. In the absence of red flags, no laboratory tests are recommended.	EO (G2)
Psychosocial Risk Factors S Assess for psychosocial risk factors (yellow flags) and conduct a detailed review if there is no improvement (see Appendix E for summary of yellow	SR (G2, G4)

flags, and the companion documents Clinical Assessment for Psychosocial Yellow Flags and Management of Psychosocial Yellow Flags ). Psychosocial risk factors include fear, financial problems, anger, depression, job dissatisfaction, family problems, or stress.	
Reassessment of Patients Whose Symptoms Fail to Resolve S Reassess patients whose symptoms are not resolving. •	Follow-up in one week if pain is severe and has not subsided. •	Follow-up in six weeks if not substantially recovered. •	Consider further appropriate management if serious pathology (red flag) is identified. Identify psychosocial risk factors (yellow flags) and address appropriately (see Appendix E for definitions of red and yellow flags, and the companion documents Clinical Assessment for Psychosocial Yellow Flags and Management of Psychosocial Yellow Flags for chronicity and increased disability).	G (G2, G4)
Information and Reassurance S Educate the patient and describe the typically benign, long-term course of low back pain. Provide educational materials that are consistent with your verbal advice to reduce fear and anxiety (see patient information sheets and brochures). Other methods for providing self-care education, such as e-mail discussion groups and videos, are not well studied, but may also be beneficial (see http://www.ihe.ca/research-programs/hta/aagap).	SR (G1, G2, G4)
Advice to Stay Active S Advise patient to stay active and continue his/her usual activity, including work, within the limits permitted by the pain. Recommend physical exercise. Patients should limit/pace any activity or exercise that causes spread of symptoms (peripheralization). Self-treating with an exercise program not specifically designed for the patient may aggravate symptoms.	SR (G1, G2, G4)
Therapeutic Exercise	SR (G2c, G4, IHE
S Recommend exercise in the treatment of subacute low back pain. The specific type of exercise may vary. Progressive exercise is based on a number of variables that include but are not limited to increasing physical activity, education regarding pain, and a graded exercise program. Emphasis should	database)

be on optimizing function and de-emphasizing pain. Refer patients whose pain is exacerbated by physical activity and exercise to a spinal care specialist such as a physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine for individualized advice. Patients should limit/pace any activity or exercise that causes spread of symptoms (peripheralization). Self-treating with an exercise program not specifically designed for the patient may aggravate symptoms.	
Return to Work S Encourage early return to work. Refer workers with low back pain beyond six weeks to a comprehensive return-to-work rehabilitation program. Effective programs are typically multidisciplinary and involve case management, education about keeping active, psychological or behavioural treatment, and participation in an exercise program. Working despite some residual discomfort poses no threat and will not harm patients.	SR (G1, G2)
Heat or Cold Packs J Recommend superficial heat (application of heating pads or heated blankets) for the short-term relief of acute low back pain.	SR (G1, G2)
Clinical experience supports a role for superficial cold packs and alternating heat and cold as per patient preference. Heat or cold should not be applied directly to the skin, and not for longer than 15 to 20 minutes. Use with care if lack of protective sensation.	EO (GUC)
Analgesia S Prescribe medication, if necessary, for pain relief preferably to be taken at regular intervals. First choice acetaminophen; second choice NSAIDs. Only consider adding a short course of muscle relaxant (benzodiazepines, cyclobenzaprine, or antispasticity drugs) on its own, or added to NSAIDs, if acetaminophen or NSAIDs have failed to reduce pain. Serious adverse effects of NSAIDs include gastrointestinal complications (e.g., bleeding, perforation, and increased blood pressure). Drowsiness, dizziness, and dependency are common adverse effects of muscle relaxants. See Medication Table in Appendix F.	SR (G1, G2, G4, G7, IHE Database)
Clinical Practice Guideline

Recommendations
 
Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p.25)
BRIEF Course of Narcotic Analgesics (Opioids) S Cautious and responsible use of opioids should only be considered for carefully selected patients with severe acute pain not controlled with acetaminophen and NSAIDs, at a minimum effective dose only for a limited period of time, usually less than one to two weeks. Ongoing need for opioids is an indication for reassessment. In general, opioids and compound analgesics have a substantially increased risk of side effects and risk of dependence compared with acetaminophen alone. Advise patient to avoid driving until cognitive side effects have been ruled out.	SR (G1, G2c, IHE Database)
Manual Therapy - Spinal Manipulation S Patients who are not improving may benefit from referral for spinal manipulation provided by a spinal care specialist such as a physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine. Risk of serious complication after spinal manipulation is low (estimated risk: Cauda Equina Syndrome less than one in one million). Current guidelines contraindicate manipulation in patients with severe or progressive neurological deficit.	SR (G1, G2c, G4)
Multidisciplinary Treatment Programs for Occupationally-Related Subacute Low Back Pain S For subacute low back pain (duration four to eight weeks), intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation (defined as an intervention that includes a physician consultation coordinated with a psychological, physical therapy, social, or vocational intervention) is moderately effective. There is evidence that functional restoration with a cognitive-behavioural component reduces work absenteeism.	SR (G1)
Bed Rest X DO NOT prescribe bed rest as a treatment. If the patient must rest, bed rest should be limited to no more than two days. Prolonged bed rest for more than four days is not recommended for acute low back problems. Bed rest for longer than two days increases the amount of sick leave compared with early resumption of normal activity in acute low back pain. There is evidence that prolonged bed rest is harmful.	SR (G2, G4, G7)

Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p.25)
Diagnostic Imaging X DO NOT order diagnostic imaging test, including x-ray, CT, and MRI for acute low back pain (no red flags). In the absence of red flags, routine use of x-rays is not justified due to the risk of high doses of radiation and lack of specificity.	SR (G1, G2c, G4, G8)
Imaging to Rule out underlying Pathology in the Absence of Radiculopathy X DO NOT order imaging where the results are not going to affect treatment.	EO (GUC)
Antibiotic Treatment Based on MRI Modic Changes X DO NOT prescribe antibiotic treatment in primary care.	EO (GUC)
Traction X DO NOT use traction. Traction has been associated with significant adverse events. Passive treatment modalities such as traction should be avoided as monotherapy and not routinely be used because they may increase the risk of illness behavior and chronicity. Adverse effects from traction include reduced muscle tone, bone demineralization, and thrombophlebitis.	SR (G1, G2c, G4, G7)
Therapeutic Ultrasound X DO NOT use therapeutic ultrasound for acute or subacute low back pain.	RCT (G1) + SR (IHE Database)
Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) X DO NOT use TENS for acute low back pain.	SR (G1, G4)
Oral Steroids X DO NOT use oral steroids for acute low back pain.	EO ( G2a,b)
Systemic Steroids X DO NOT prescribe systemic corticosteroids (intramuscular injection) for treatment of patients with acute low back pain and a negative result on a straight-leg-raise test.	RCT (G1)

Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p.25)
Epidural Steroid Injections in the Presence of Radiculopathy ? There is inconclusive evidence to recommend for or against epidural steroid injections in the presence of radiculopathy. Image-guided epidural steroid injections may be helpful for some patients with lumbar radicular pain for longer than six weeks who have not responded to non-interventional treatments. Clinical experience suggests that patients who have responded favourably (improved function and pain relief) to an epidural steroid injection may benefit from a follow-up injection after three months. Adverse effects are infrequent and include headache, fever, and subdural penetration; rare but catastrophic events, including epidural abscess and paralysis, can occur. See Appendix G and the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology for further information.	SR (G4) + EO (GUC)
Multidisciplinary Treatment programs ? No evidence was found to recommend interdisciplinary rehabilitation for acute low back pain (pain less than four weeks).	SR (G1)
Antidepressants and Anticonvulsants as Adjuvant Therapies Analgesic Antidepressants ? There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against analgesic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, other tricyclic antidepressants, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for acute low back pain with or without leg dominant pain.

Chronic Low Back Pain
Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p. 25
Diagnostic Imaging S Lumbar spine x-rays may be required for correlation prior to more sophisticated diagnostic imaging, for example prior to an MRI scan. In this case, the views should be limited to standing AP and lateral in order to achieve better assessment of stability and stenosis. CT scans are best limited to suspected fractures or contraindication to MRI. X-rays of the lumbar spine are very poor indicators of serious pathology. Hence, in the absence of clinical red flags spinal x-rays are not encouraged. More specific and appropriate diagnostic imaging should be performed on the basis of the pathology being sought (e.g., DEXA scan for bone density and bone scan for tumours and inflammatory diseases). In the absence of red flags, radiculopathy, or neurogenic claudication, MRI scanning is generally of limited value. Oblique view x-rays are not recommended; they add only minimal information in a small percentage of cases and more than double the patient’s exposure to radiation.	EO (GUC)
Exercise and Therapeutic Exercise S Recommend exercise and therapeutic exercise. Encourage patient to initiate gentle exercise and to gradually increase the exercise level within his/her pain tolerance. Sophisticated equipment is not necessary. Other options may include unsupervised walking and group exercise programs, such as those offered by chronic disease management programs. The peer support of group exercise is likely to result in better outcomes, giving patients improved confidence and empowering them to manage with less medical intervention. When exercise exacerbates the patient's pain, the exercise program should be assessed by a qualified physical therapist or exercise specialist. If exercise persistently exacerbates their pain, patients should be further assessed by a physician to determine if further investigation, medication, treatment, or consultation is required. Some studies reported mild negative reactions to exercise programs, such as increased low back pain and muscle soreness in some patients.	SR (G6, G11)
Therapeutic Aquatic Exercise S Recommend therapeutic aquatic exercise for chronic low back pain.	SR (IHE Database)

Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p. 25
Yoga Therapy S There is some evidence that Viniyoga and Iyengar types of yoga can be helpful in the treatment of chronic low back pain. No evidence was found to recommend other types of yoga. It is important to find an instructor who has experience in working with individuals who have low back pain to avoid further injury.	SR (IHE Database)
Education S Provide brief education to optimize function. Brief education is defined as review of clinical examination results, provision of low back pain information and advice to stay active, and reduction of fear and catastrophizing.	SR (G11)
Self-Management Programs S Recommend, if available, a structured community-based self-management group program for a patient interested in learning pain coping skills. These programs are offered through chronic disease management and chronic pain programs. Self-management programs focus on teaching core skills, such as self-monitoring of symptoms, to determine likely causal factors in pain exacerbations or ameliorations, activity pacing, relaxation techniques, communication skills, and modification of negative ‘self-talk’ or catastrophizing. These programs use goal setting and ‘homework assignments’ to encourage participants’ self confidence in their ability to successfully manage their pain and increase their day-to-day functioning. Most community-based programs also include exercise and activity programming, which are also recommended. Where structured group programs are not available, refer to a trained professional for individual self-management counselling.	G (G6)
Manual Therapy - Massage Therapy S Recommend massage therapy as an adjunct to a broader active rehabilitation program.	SR (G6)
Acupuncture S Recommend acupuncture as a short-term therapy or as an adjunct to a broader active rehabilitation program. No serious adverse events were reported in the clinical trials. The incidence of minor adverse events was 5%.	SR (G6, G11)

Recommendations
 
Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p. 25
Acetominophen and Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) S Recommend acetaminophen and NSAIDs. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be considered for patients over 45 years of age when using an oral NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor. Cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal risks, and comorbidities need to be taken into account when prescribing any NSAID. NSAIDs are associated with mild to moderately severe side effects such as: abdominal pain, bleeding, diarrhea, edema, dry mouth, rash, dizziness, headache, and tiredness. See Medication Table in Appendix F.	SR (G6, IHE Database) + EO (GUC)
Muscle Relaxants S Muscle relaxants (e.g., cyclobenzaprine) may be appropriate in selected patients for symptomatic relief of pain and muscle spasm. Caution must be exercised with managing side effects, particularly drowsiness, and also with patient selection given the abuse potential for this class of drugs. See Medication Table in Appendix F.	SR (G6)
Analgesic Antidepressants (amitriptyline and nortriptyline) S Tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and nortriptyline may have a small to moderate effect for chronic low back pain with or without leg dominant pain at much lower doses than might be used for depression. Possible side effects include drowsiness and anticholinergic effects. See Medication Table in Appendix F.	SR (G6, IHE Database)
Herbal Medicine S The following herbal medicines can be considered as treatment options for acute exacerbations of chronic low back pain: •	An aqueous extract of Harpagophytum procumbens (also called devil's claw, grapple plant, wood spider) at a standardized daily dosage of 50 mg harpagoside •	A combination of extract of Salix daphnoides and Salix purpurea (also called purple willow, red willow) at a standardized dosage of 240 mg salicin/day •	A plaster of Capsicum frutescens (also called bird pepper, hot pepper, red chili, spur pepper, Tabasco pepper)	SR (IHE Database)

Recommendation	Evidence Source (See Legend p. 25
Devil’s claw is associated with the following adverse events: repeated coughs, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal upset. Use of Capsicum frutescens plaster is associated with inflammatory contact eczema, urtcaria, minute hemorrhagic spots, vesiculation or dermatitis, sensation of warmth locally, and pruritus. Patients should be advised to read the product ingredients to ensure they are getting the correct amount and correct product mentioned in the recommendation. It is important to be aware that a product could list on the label different extracts of the same active ingredient (e.g., devil’s Claw and wood spider). Devil’s Claw, Salix, and Capsicum frutescens are currently regulated by Health Canada (see http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodnatur/applications/licen-prod/lnhpd-bdpsnh-eng.php).	
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy S Where group chronic pain cognitive behavioural therapy programs are not available, consider referral for individual cognitive behavioural therapy provided by a psychologist or other qualified provider with training and/or experience in cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic pain management.	SR (G6)
Respondent Behavioural Therapies (progressive relaxation or EMG biofeedback) S Progressive relaxation or electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback can be considered for chronic pain.	SR (G11)
Multidisciplinary Treatment Program S Refer patient significantly affected by chronic low back pain and no improvement with primary care management to a multidisciplinary chronic pain program.	SR (G6, G11)
Referral for Surgical Opinion S Refer patients who: •	Are engaged in an optimal package of care including a combined physical and psychological treatment program (usually six months of care); and •	Still have severe low back pain for which the patient would consider surgery, particularly if related to spinal stenosis with leg pain or claudication To optimize surgical outcome, anyone with significant psychological distress should be referred for appropriate treatment.

Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) X DO NOT use TENS as a sole treatment for chronic low back pain.	SR (G6)
Lumbar Discography in Primary Care X DO NOT recommend lumbar discography in primary care. Discography may be relevant as a diagnostic test before surgery in a patient with degenerative disc disease for diagnosis of discogenic back pain. However, the patient must have the ability to report if the pain produced by the injection is the same as the primary complaint. Discography is a controversial test because it: •	Is painful, invasive, and expert-dependent •	May induce further disc degeneration •	Carries the risk of neurological injury and infection	SR (IHE Database) + NRCS (G9)

When the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy is suspected, cross-sectional imaging is the diagnostic test of choice.	
Diagnostic Selective Nerve Root Blocks (SNRBs) in Primary Care X DO NOT order diagnostic SNRBs in primary care. There is evidence to support their use in specialty services to assist in diagnosis when multiple levels may be involved; they require specialist followup to interpret.

Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) as an Adjunct Treatment ? TENS may be useful as an adjunct in select patients for pain control to reduce the need for medications. A short trial (two to three treatments) using different stimulation parameters should be sufficient to determine if the patient will respond to this modality. Skin irritation is a common adverse event.	EO (G6)
Therapeutic ultrasound ? There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of therapeutic ultrasound for chronic low back pain. Based on expert opinion, this modality is overused relative to any potential therapeutic benefit.	SR (IHE Database)
Epidural Steroid Injections ? There is inconclusive evidence to recommend for or against epidural steroid injections. For patients with leg pain, image-guided epidural steroid injections may be effective in providing short-term and occasional long-term pain relief. Clinical experience suggests that patients who have responded favourably (improved function and pain relief) to an epidural steroid injection may benefit from a follow-up injection after three months. Adverse effects are infrequent and include headache, fever, and subdural penetration; rare but catastrophic events, including epidural abscess and paralysis, can occur.

Opioids ? Evidence is lacking for long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain. However, there is some evidence of the benefit of opioids for short-term pain and function improvements. Long-term use of opioids should only follow an unsuccessful trial of nonopioid analgesics. In severe chronic pain, strong opioids require careful consideration. Long-acting opioids are preferred as they can establish a steady state blood and tissue level that may minimize the patient's experience of unsteady dosing (cyclical improvement and/or withdrawal) from short-acting opioids. Any use of opioids over the long term will lead to physical dependence. Avoid escalating doses above 50 mg/day if initiating, and above 90 mg/day oral morphine equivalent for ongoing use. Careful attention to incremental improvements in pain or function is required to justify ongoing use of opioids. Because little is known about the long-term effects of therapy it should be monitored carefully. A history of addiction is a relative contraindication. Consultation with an addictions specialist may be helpful in these cases. Opioid side effects (including headache, nausea, somnolence, constipation, dry mouth, and dizziness and opiate-induced hyperalgesia and	SR (G6, G11, IHE Database) + EO (GUC)

Background
Introduction
This guideline has been adapted from eleven “seed” guidelines for prevention and treatment of acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain published between 2003 and 2014 (referenced as G1 through G11; see Seed Guideline References).
When considering recommended interventions it is important to take into account the patient's expectations and preferences, but do not use his/her expectations and preferences to predict response to treatments. Discrepancies between patient expectations and preferences and evidence-informed practice could reflect a lack of awareness. This presents an opportunity for dialogue, mutual decision-making, and utilizing educational resources.
The most common type of low back pain is called 'non-specific low back pain' and accounts for approximately 90% of cases in primary care settings.16 Less than 2% of people with low back pain have potentially serious spine conditions that will require surgery or medical intervention.6,7
Up to 84% of people in developed countries will experience at least one episode of low back pain during their lifetime, with up to 23% of the adult population suffering from back pain at any given time.15 8 Back pain is usually self-limiting and resolves within two to six weeks, but symptoms may linger for up to two months.5,9-12 A small minority of patients (2% to 7%) will develop chronic low back pain.5,9 Given that low back pain is common and predominantly benign, it is helpful to think of it as a condition of life rather than a medical problem that always requires investigation and intervention.
The initial aim of the primary care practitioner is to identify the small proportion of patients with serious pathology or barriers to recovery by recognizing the clinical “red flags” and “yellow flags”.
The vast majority of patients with non-specific low back pain need to be reassured about the very low

Background
 
risk of a serious disorder being present, educated about the natural history of low back pain, and encouraged to self-manage whenever possible.
The role of the primary care practitioner is to normalize the patient's experience in line with the expected course of recovery, while explaining that recurrences are common. At least 25% of patients will experience further episodes within a year, and over three quarters will have a recurrence at some point in their lives.5-8-9-12-13 Many patients who understand the benign and common nature of their complaint and who have access to appropriate self-management techniques are able to manage future recurrences on their own. Nonetheless, there will be instances where patients will need to have their low back pain managed in primary care because of severity, disability, or uncertainty. When indicated, patients can be given pain relieving medications, informed about the various therapeutic modalities for which there is some positive evidence, and referred to specialty care in the minority of cases in which it is required.
Investigations
A precise anatomical diagnosis is not required to determine an effective treatment plan for nonspecific low back pain. Imaging can lead to unnecessary costs and inferior patient outcomes. Finding irrelevant anatomic abnormalities can lead to diagnostic confusion and patient anxiety, as well as to unnecessary additional expense. In the absence of “red flags”, x-rays and advanced imaging are only indicated when the results will inform a treatment plan that includes surgery or another interventional therapy. Imaging findings alone rarely lead to a change in treatment plan, and there is some evidence that imaging in the absence of red flags does not reassure patients.14,15
When imaging is ordered, the results need to be explained to the patient in a way that normalizes the findings and does not attribute them to the cause of pain, except when the results will lead to a change in treatment or when “red flags” such as fracture, infec tion, or neoplasm are present. This applies regardless of whether nerve root compression radiculopathy is present or not as the initial management pathway is the same. Imaging can usually be deferred until the patient's clinical response to conservative treatment has been determined, except in cases of severe or progressive radicular pain when more urgent investigation and interventional management may be needed.
Rehabilitation
Exercise and activity have a positive role in the treatment of low back pain, but current evidence does not support detailed recommendations on the duration, frequency, and specific type of exercises. However, it is reasonable to consider specific exercises provided by a qualified examiner that are tailored to patients' needs and interests.
Many experts consider active rehabilitation to be preferable to passive treatment, particularly when patients have not responded to a brief trial of passive therapies. Active rehabilitation includes:
•	Education about back pain principles;
•	Self-management programming (see Self-Management Programs recommendation);
•	Gradual resumption of normal activities (including work and physical exercise) as tolerated;
•	Therapeutic exercise (see Exercise and Therapeutic Exercise recommendations).
Clinical Practice Guideline
Page 22 of 49
Background
 
Some of the rehabilitation interventions currently undergoing active research are listed in this guideline as Do Not Know recommendations to reflect the fact that there is as yet insufficient or inconclusive evidence of their efficacy in treating low back pain.
Communication
Rapport and the development of an effective therapeutic alliance can have a significant impact on patient engagement. Providers have the opportunity to enhance patient wellbeing by encouraging self-management, adaptation to physical limitations, and return to highly valued activities including work and exercise as early as tolerated. Patient information pamphlets, booklets, and videos can be effective tools for enhancing patients' understanding and acceptance of back pain and its commonly transient nature, as well as strategies for minimizing the chance of future recurrence.
Medication
While there have been some studies of medications used specifically for low back pain, in many cases the probable effectiveness has to be inferred from more general studies of the management of painful conditions generally, either acute or chronic.
When it is possible to differentiate pain as having nociceptive, neuropathic, inflammatory, infectious or malignant qualities then appropriate medication selection will naturally follow. In non-malignant low back pain, most pain is nociceptive or neuropathic in nature. Medications for either classification can be selected in a step-wise fashion as summarized in the Medication Table (Appendix F). Any medication should be tapered and withdrawn if it is clearly not improving pain or function. It is also important for patients to understand that successful use of medications may not bring complete pain relief. With chronic pain, a reduction of pain by 30 or 40% may be considered a success with no further gains to be made by increasing the medication dosing.
The use of opiates in chronic low back pain remains controversial due to the lack of adequate research demonstrating long-term efficacy in this population.

Appendix B - Evidence Source
The Evidence Source provides information on the “seed” guideline(s) that were used to develop the Alberta guideline recommendations and the design of the studies referenced by the seed guideline(s) in support of their recommendations.
The following evidence sources were considered:
•	Systematic review (SR): as cited by the seed guideline(s) or identified from a supplementary literature search required by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) or Guideline Update Committee (GUC). The literature search spanned from January 1996 to August 2007 for the first edition of this guideline, from January 2002 to December 2010 for the second edition, and from January 2010 to April 2014 for the third edition.
•	Randomized controlled trial (RCT): as cited by the seed guideline(s)
•	Non-randomized comparative study (NRCS) as cited by the seed guideline(s)
•	Case series (CS): as cited by the seed guideline(s)
•	Guideline (G): as cited by the seed guideline(s)
•	Expert opinion (EO) as cited by the seed guideline(s): when no evidence was provided by the “seed” guideline(s) in support of the recommendation
•	EO (GDG) or EO (GUC): after examining the individual studies cited by the seed guideline(s) or additional SRs on low back pain, as identified by a supplementary literature search spanning from January 1996 to April 2014 (see above), the original recommendation was rejected and a new one was drafted based on the collective EO of the Ambassador GDG or GUC
For evidence cited by the seed guideline(s), only the highest level of evidence was listed. For example, when the evidence cited by a seed guideline was from SRs and studies of other design (i.e., RCT, NRCS, CS, or G) only SR is listed as the source. When no SR was referenced in the seed guideline, the evidence source was indicated in the following order: RCT, NRCS, CS, G, EO. The same classification for the evidence source was applied when multiple seed guidelines were used to inform one recommendation.
Each recommendation in the Alberta guideline came from one or more seed guidelines or was created by the GDG or GUC, based on their collective professional opinion and an analysis of relevant evidence. The GDG constructed the first edition of the Alberta guideline. Subsequent editions were constructed by the GUC.

Behavioural treatment (BT) & Cognitive behav ioural treatment (CBT)	BT: There are three behavioural treatment approaches: operant, cognitive, and respondent. Each of these focuses on the modification of one of the three response systems that characterize emotional experiences: behaviour, cognition, and physiological reactivity. CBT: A range of therapies based on psychological models of human cognition, learning and behaviour that are usually taught as a “package” and are intended to provide patients with a variety of skills for managing their pain.
Brief education in a clinical setting	Brief education in clinical setting is defined as review of the patient's clinical examination results, provision of low back pain information and advice to stay active, and reduction of fear and catastrophizing.
Catastrophizing	Exaggerating the potential or real consequences of an event and becoming fearful of these consequences.
Chronic low back pain	Pain present for more than three months.
Craniosacral therapy	An alternative treatment approach that involves applying a gentle manual force to address somatic dysfunctions of the head and body, with the aim of releasing restrictions around the spinal cord and brain and restoring body function.
Electrodiagnostic studies	Studies performed in the electromyography (EMG) laboratory, including nerve conduction studies, F-waves, somatosensory evoked potentials, and EMG.
Electromyography (EMG)	The recording of electrical activity generated in skeletal muscle for diagnostic purposes. EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram.
Exercise	Therapeutic exercises are prescribed according to the results of an individual patient assessment. Recommendations are based on the specific impairments identified. Supervised exercise programs and formal home exercise regimens range from programs aimed at general physical fitness or aerobic exercise to programs aimed at muscle strengthening, flexibility, stretching, or different combinations of these elements.

Functional restoration (also called physical conditioning, work hardening, or work conditioning)	An intervention that involves simulated or actual work tests in a supervised environment in order to enhance job performance skills and improve strength, endurance, flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness in injured workers.
Interdisciplinary rehabilitation (also called multidisciplinary therapy)	A biopsychosocial intervention that combines and coordinates physical, vocational, and behavioural components and is provided by multiple health care professionals with different clinical backgrounds. The intensity and content of interdisciplinary therapy varies widely.
Interferential current therapy	The superficial application of a medium-frequency alternating current modulated to produce low frequencies up to 150 Hz. It is thought to increase blood flow to tissues and provide pain relief and is considered more comfortable for patients than transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.
Intramuscular stimulation	Uses very thin needles to 'dry needle' affected areas without the injection of any substance. IMS differs from acupuncture in its application because needle insertion is indicated by physical signs as opposed to the predetermined meridians of acupuncture. IMS is based on known scientific, neurophysiological principles.
Low-level laser therapy	The superficial application of lasers at wavelengths between 632 and 904 nm to the skin in order to apply electromagnetic energy to soft tissue. Optimal treatment parameters (wavelength, dosage, doseintensity, and type of laser) are uncertain.
Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy	Localized displacement of disc material beyond the normal margins of the intervertebral disc space resulting in pain, weakness or numbness in a myotomal or dermatomal distribution.
Lumbar discography	Procedure that is used to characterize the pathoanatomy and architecture of the intervertebral disc and to determine if the intervertebral disc is a source of chronic low back pain.
Lumbar supports	External devices designed to reduce spinal mobility.
Manual therapy	Manual therapy (MT) is an umbrella term that has increasingly been adopted to encompass various forms of hands-on treatment, including both manipulation and mobilization (see spinal manipulative therapy and spinal mobilization). Manual therapy as a treatment option in the management of pain is an intervention that is practised by a variety of healthcare professionals including physiotherapists, osteopaths, and chiropractors. Philosophical differences exist both within and between the various professions regarding the possible mechanisms of action of manual therapy.
Massage	Soft tissue manipulation using the hands or a mechanical device through a variety of specific methods. The pressure and intensity used in different massage techniques vary widely.
Medial branch block	An injection of local anesthetic, with or without corticosteroid medication, in the area of the medial branch of the posterior primary ramus, the primary nerve innervating the intervertebral facet joint, to diagnose or treat back pain.

	Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology.
Mindfulness	The skill of non-judgmentally observing emotions, sensations, or cognitions (moment-to-moment awareness). It is learned through meditation exercises that have been adapted from Buddhist traditions.
Motorized traction	An intervention involving drawing or pulling in order to stretch the lumbar spine. Various methods are used, usually involving a harness around the lower rib cage and the iliac crest, with the pulling action done by using free weights and a pulley, motorized equipme nt, inversion techniques, or an overhead harness.
MRI	Magnetic resonance imaging; an imaging technique used to image internal structures of the body, particularly the soft tissues without use of radiation.
Multidisciplinary therapy (multidisciplinary treatment programs)	See Interdisciplinary rehabilitation.
Nonspecific low back pain	Pain occurring primarily in the back with no signs of a serious underlying condition (such as cancer, infection, or Cauda Equina Syndrome), spinal stenosis or radiculopathy, or another specific spinal cause (such as vertebral compression fracture or ankylosing spondylitis). Degenerative changes on lumbar imaging are usually considered nonspecific, as they correlate poorly with symptoms.
Osteopathic physician	The training of osteopathic physicians incorporates the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal conditions. Osteopathic manual therapy, including manipulation, can be an important part of treatment.
Physiotherapy provided operant conditioning	Operant conditioning is defined as a time contingent, graduated increase in activity including goal setting and the education and reinforcement of positive pain behaviours with the ultimate aim of decreasing disability and increasing function.
Prevention of occurrence of low back pain	Reduction of the incidence (first-time onset) of low back pain or the risk of new cases appearing, i.e., primary prevention.
Prevention of recurrence of low back pain	Reduction of the occurrence of a new episode of low back pain after a symptom-free period in patients who have previously experienced low back pain, i.e., secondary prevention.
Progressive (muscle) relaxation	A technique that involves the deliberate tensing and relaxation of muscles to facilitate the recognition and release of muscle tension.
Prolotherapy	Injections of irritant solutions to strengthen lumbosacral ligaments.
Proton pump inhibitor	A type of drug that reduces the production of acid in the stomach, and is used to treat indigestion and stomach ulcers.
Radiculopathy	Dysfunction of a nerve root associated with pain, sensory impairment, weakness, or diminished deep tendon reflexes in a nerve root distribution. The most common symptom of lumbar radiculopathy is sciatica.
Radiofrequency neurotomy	Application of a high-frequency electrical current via an electrode to spinal nerves to destroy nerve function and interrupt pain signals to the brain. Also known as radiofrequency ablation.

	See also the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology.
Red flags	Clinical (i.e. physical) features that may alert to the presence of serious but relatively uncommon conditions or diseases requiring evaluation. Such conditions include tumours, infection, fractures, and neurological damage/ disease.
Respondent therapy using EMG biofeedback	A therapy aimed at modifying physiological response to pain by reducing muscular tension. It is based on the idea of a pain-tension cycle, where pain is viewed as both a cause and a result of muscular tension. Respondent therapy attempts to interrupt this cycle by using a tension-incompatible reaction, such as relaxation. EMG biofeedback is frequently used to reduce the assumed muscular tension, relieve anxiety, and subsequently pain (see separate glossary entry).
Sacroiliac joint block	An injection of local anesthetic, with or without corticosteroid medication, into the sacroiliac joint to diagnose or treat low back pain associated with sacroiliac joint dysfunction. See also the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology.
Sciatica	Pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back, through the buttock, and down the back of the leg. Sciatica can be caused by irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve.
Selective nerve root block (SNRB)	An injection of local anesthetic, with or without other substances such as corticosteroid medication, along a specific nerve root that exits from the spinal cord to diagnose or treat nerve root pain in the back. Also known as selective transforaminal epidural injection. See also the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology.
Shock-wave treatment	Application of low-frequency sound waves (10, 50, 100, or 250 Hz) to the skin, causing an oscillatory pressure in the underlying soft tissue. Also commonly known as “vibrotherapy”.
Short-wave diathermy	Therapeutic elevation of the temperature of deep tissues by application of short-wave electromagnetic radiation with a frequency range from 10-100 MHz.
Spa therapy	An intervention involving several interventions, including mineral water bathing, usually with heated water, and other interventions such as massage and exercise, typically while staying at a spa resort.
Spinal care specialist	A physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine.
Spinal manipulative therapy	Application of high-velocity, low-amplitude manual thrusts to the spinal joints slightly beyond the passive range of joint motion. This may be accompanied by an audible ‘crack’ or ‘pop’.
Spinal mobilization	Application of manual force to the spinal joints within the passive range of joint motion that does not involve a thrust.
Spinal stenosis	A condition in which there is diminished space available for the neural and vascular elements in the lumbar spine, secondary to degenerative changes in the spinal canal. When symptomatic, this causes a variable clinical syndrome of gluteal and/or lower extremity pain and/or fatigue, which may occur with or without back pain.

Red Flags (Adapted from G2, G4, G6, G7, G8, EO [GDG/GUC])
Definitions
Emergency - referral within hours
Urgent - referral within 24 - 48 hours
Soon - within weeks
Depending on the clinical situation, consider communicating with the specialist consultant to determine the urgency and timelines for referral.
While patient is waiting to be seen by specialist: general advice is analgesia, rest and activity avoidance. Advise patient that tests are needed to clarify the diagnosis but that results may be inconclusive.
•	Cauda equina syndrome (sudden or progressive onset of new urinary retention, fecal incontinence, saddle (perineal) anesthesia, radicular (leg) pain often bilateral, loss of voluntary rectal sphincter contraction) - EMERGENCY referral to ER
•	Severe unremitting (non-mechanical) worsening of pain (at night and pain when laying down), consider infection or tumor - URGENT referral to ER for pain control and prompt investigation
•	Significant trauma, consider fractures - check for instability and refer URGENTLY to spinal surgery if indicated
•	Weight loss, fever, history of cancer or HIV, consider infection or tumor -URGENT referral for MRI scan and to spinal surgery if indicated
•	Use of IV drugs or steroids, consider infection or compression fracture - URGENT investigation required. In case of suspected infection, consider blood work (CBC and ESR or CRP). If blood work is positive, proceed to MRI, if available. In case of suspected compression fracture, proceed to standing AP and lateral x-rays
Risk factors for compression fractures include: severe onset of pain with minor trauma in patients >50 years of age (higher risk >65 years of age), history of prolonged corticosteroid intake, or structural deformity
•	Widespread neurological signs, consider tumor or neurological disease - investigate further and refer SOON if indicated
•	Patient over 50 years of age, but particularly over 65 years of age, with first episode of severe back pain, if other risk factors for malignancy are present (history of cancer/carcinoma in the last 15 years, unexplained weight loss, failure of conservative care [four weeks]) - investigate further, refer SOON as indicated

Yellow Flags16
Yellow Flags indicate psychosocial barriers to recovery that may increase the risk of long term disability and work loss. Identifying any Yellow Flags may help when improvement is delayed. There is more about Clinical Assessment for Psychosocial Yellow Flags and Management of Psychosocial Yellow Flags in the companion documents to this guideline.
Yellow Flags include:
Yellow Flag	Intervention
Belief that pain and activity are harmful	Educate and consider referral to active rehab including CBT
‘Sickness behaviours’ (like extended rest)	Educate and consider pain clinic referral
Low or negative moods, social withdrawal	Assess for psychopathology and treat
Treatment beliefs do not fit best practice	Educate
Problems with claim and compensation	Connect with stakeholders and case manage
History of back pain, time-off, other claims	Follow-up regularly refer if recovering slowly
Problems at work, poor job satisfaction	Engage case management through disability carrier
Heavy work, unsociable hours (shift work)	Follow-up regularly refer if recovering slowly
Overprotective family or lack of support	Educate patient and family

Appendix G - Injection Therapies
Source: EO (GDG/GUC)
Injections therapies, including Prolotherapy, Facet Joint Blocks, Medial Branch Blocks, and Neurotomy are areas of active research and the clinical factors that predict their optimum use remain undetermined at present. Nonetheless, clinically, there appears to be reason to support their use in carefully selected patients. At present they are recommended only for patients selected by a clinician with training and experience in evaluating the physical examination findings that the receiving consultant physician has agreed are predictive of successful intervention. The referring clinician may be another physician with an interest in these treatment modalities, or a similarly qualified physiotherapist or chiropractor. This requires a degree of local co-operation to establish the appropriate referral networks, which is not feasible in all settings.
Physical examination findings predictive of facet joint origin for low back pain:
While published research suggests a significant degree of inter-examiner variability in interpreting physical examination findings, the following are considered by the authors to be suggestive of a facet joint origin for low back pain. Within the limitations noted above, such patients may be considered for referral for facet joint blocks as a confirmatory test:
•	Pain is often of rapid onset
•	Pain is unilateral or bilateral at or above the belt-line. If radiation to the leg is present it tends to be to the buttocks or lateral thigh and rarely below the knee
•	Pain tends to be worse with low back extension, and may be relieved with flexion or sitting
•	Pain may be provoked with palpation over the paravertebral tissues in the area of the facet joints lateral to the midline, and often under several layers of muscle that may also be pain generators
•	Pain may be provoked by “facet joint loading maneuvers” on physical examination, for example: while standing with feet pointing ahead at shoulder distance apart, the patient is asked to look over one shoulder, followed by trunk rotation to the same side, then lumbar extension. The resulting lumbar extension in combination with side-bending and rotation will cause facet joint loading on the same side. The examiner may need to help stabilize the patient to prevent a loss of balance
Similarly, the following findings are considered by the authors to be suggestive of a sacroiliac joint origin for low back pain:
•	Pain is localized in the lower back and buttock area, usually unilaterally and just below the belt line
•	The patient points to the sacroiliac joint as the area of maximal pain
•	Pain may be aggravated by either flexion or extension, but the patient points to the same point as the pain generator
Clinical Practice Guideline
Page 39 of 49
Appendix G - Injection Therapies
 
•	Pain is reproduced with palpation along the affected sacroiliac joint
•	Pain is amplified by sacroiliac joint stress maneuvers such as the “Patrick” or “Figure 4” test
Central canal lumbar spinal stenosis is suspected based upon a history of neurogenic claudication:
•	Pain that is consistent in onset after a set distance walking or time standing
•	Pain is radiating into the legs bilaterally
•	Pain is relieved by sitting
•	Patients often note that they have significantly increased activity tolerance when in a lumbar flexed position e.g., cycling or swimming. They will often rely on a walker or lean on a shopping cart to mobilize
•	On examination a loss of lordosis is often noted as well as a limited or absent range of motion into extension
•	Vascular claudication has been ruled out

•	Severe worsening pain, especially at night or when lying down (urgent)
•	Significant trauma (urgent)
•	Weight loss, history of cancer, fever (urgent)
•	Use of steroids or intravenous drugs (urgent)
•	Patient with first episode of severe back pain over 50 years old, especially over 65 (soon)
•	Widespread neurological signs (soon)
EMERGENCY - referral within hours
URGENT - referral within 24 - 48 hours
SOON - referral within weeks
History taking

Low Back Pain
Do a full clinical assessment; rule out red flags and yellow flags
In the absence of red flags, reassure the patient there is no reason to suspect a serious cause
Reinforce that pain typically resolves in a few weeks without intervention, but may recur Recommend exercise and therapeutic exercise
If pain continues beyond six weeks, reassess and consider additional treatment and referrals The goal of chronic pain management is improved quality of life
Check for yellow flags and if present, follow good clinical practice’
Encourage and support pain self-management
Monitor patient for relative benefit versus side effects
