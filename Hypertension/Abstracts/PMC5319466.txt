The initial assessment of a patient with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) comprises diagnostic confirmation, suspicion and identification of the secondary cause, and assessment of CV risks. In addition, target-organ damage (TOD) and associated diseases should be investigated. Such assessment comprises BP measurement in the office and/or outside the office, by use of proper technique and validated equipment, medical history (personal and family), physical examination and clinical and laboratory investigation.

General assessments directed to all, and, in some cases, complementary assessments only for specific groups are proposed.
